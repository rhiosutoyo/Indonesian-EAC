# Emotionally Aware Chatbot for Responding to Indonesian Product Reviews
This research proposes a model to build an emotionally aware chatbot to respond to Indonesian product reviews. 
Six emotion recognition models are examined using two pre-trained models and a multilayer perceptron of a feedforward artificial neural network.
The full report can be seen in [**this link**](http://www.ijicic.org/ijicic-190315.pdf).

Moreover, this research also has evaluated the emotinally aware chatbot and its believability factor.
The experiment's evaluation results show that implementing the emotion recognition model on the chatbot increases its believability. 
* On average, the believability measures in interaction type B (with an emotion model) are enhanced 1.71 times compared to interaction type A (a basic model).
* Integrating a chatbot avatar into the interaction system also heightens the believability factor. Using avatars in chatbots increases the system's believability variables by 1.17 times compared to not using avatars.

## Resources
This work proposes a product review dataset annotated with Shaver's emotion model and several predefined response templates for each emotion to enable answer variations.
The supporting research materials are as follows:
- [**Product Review Dataset with Emotions**](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Indonesian-EAC/tree/main/dataset/product-reviews-with-emotions)<br>
It consists of Amazon Review Data that is annotated with emotions.
The reliability of agreement between annotators for the proposed product review dataset is substantial (Îº = 0.66).
- [**Knowledge Database**](https://github.com/rhiosutoyo/Indonesian-EAC/blob/main/dataset/response-templates/predefined_respond_semicolon_delimited.csv)<br>
It consists of predefined response templates for answering product reviews.
