# Emotionally Aware Chatbot for Responding to Indonesian Product Reviews
This research proposes a model to build an emotionally aware chatbot for responding to Indonesian product reviews. Six emotion recognition models are examined using two pre-trained models and a multilayer perceptron of a feedforward artificial neural network. Hyperparameter tuning is performed on all models to find the optimum performance.
